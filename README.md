## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an automated defect detection system for solar panels. It can identify 6 types of issues including:
- Crack
- Black core
- Finger
- Short circuit
- Horizontal dislocation
- Thick line

The model is trained on a labeled dataset in YOLO format and evaluated for real-world performance.
